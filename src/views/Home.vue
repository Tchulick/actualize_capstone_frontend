    <P>
      I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit
      with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Yes, if you make it look like an
      electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
      <br />
      Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Anyone
      who laughs is a communist! Shut up and get to the point! Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute.
      <br />
      I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Kif might! Can we have Bender Burgers again? Oh, how
      awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.
      Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Oh dear! She's
      stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.
      <br />
      And until then, I can never die? These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing
      where they are. Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? But I know you in the future. I cleaned
      your poop. Guess again. It's a T. It goes "tuh". You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Oh Leela! You're the only
      person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy'
      you!
